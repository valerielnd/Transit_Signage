This application needs the following libraries to run:
------------------------------------------------------------------
- Wt 4.9.1
- libcurl 7.88
- nlohmann/json.hpp
- gumbo-parser
- gumbo-query

These following libraries were installed on a Ubuntu 22.04 with git enabled using the following steps:

**libcurl 7.88***
*****************
- sudo apt-get update
- wget https://curl.se/download/curl-7.88.1.zip
- unzip curl-7.88.1.zip 
- cd curl-7.88.1/
- ./configure --with-openssl
- sudo make
- sudo make install
- sudo ldconfig

**Wt4.9.1**
***********
- sudo apt-get install gcc g++ libboost-all-dev cmake
- sudo apt-get install doxygen libssl-dev libpq-dev libssl-dev libfcgi-dev
- wget -c https://github.com/emweb/wt/archive/4.9.1.tar.gz
- tar xvxf 4.9.1.tar.gz
- cd wt-4.9.1/
- mkdir build
- cd build/
- sudo cmake ..
- sudo make
- sudo make -C examples (optional)
- sudo make install
- sudo ldconfig

**gumbo-parser**
****************
- git clone https://github.com/google/gumbo-parser.git
- cd gumbo-parser/
- sudo ./autogen.sh
- sudo ./configure
- sudo make
- sudo make install
- sudo ldconfig


**gumbo-query**
***************
- gumbo-query
- git clone https://github.com/lazytiger/gumbo-query.git
- cd gumbo-query/build && sudo cmake .. && sudo make && sudo make test
- sudo make install
- sudo ldconfig
- xport CPLUS_INCLUDE_PATH=:/usr/local/include/gq:$CPLUS_INCLUDE_PATH

If after installing each library, if the library path is not added to the LD_LIBRARY_PATH environment, you can run the following code to install it:
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/path/to/my/library:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH


Files for the project stage 3
------------------------------
The files are added to the folder named "project_stage3". Inside there are 3 folders. Inside the folder signage system, there is a makefile that can be used to run the application.

The AppView for two bus stops were created due to ressources issue: Natural science and Alumni Hall.

To access the page for the bus stop natural science, please use the following link:

- On the same computer : http://127.0.0.1:9091/natsci
- On another computer : http://IP:9091/natsci

To access for the Bus Stop Alumni Hall:

- On the same computer: http://127.0.0.1:9091/alumhal1
- On another computer: http://IP:9091/alumhal1

We are also able to run the app on a computer with public IP if you want to access it another way. We will also be happy to do a demonstration if necessary.
